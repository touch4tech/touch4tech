&lt;p&gt;Famous exploring civilisation (chat GPT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several civilizations throughout history were known for their exploration and expansion into new territories. Here are some of the most famous exploring civilizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Phoenicians (1500–300 BCE)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•   The Phoenicians were a maritime civilization based in the eastern Mediterranean (modern-day Lebanon). They were expert sailors and traders, establishing colonies across the Mediterranean, including Carthage in North Africa. Phoenician explorers are believed to have ventured as far as the British Isles and possibly circumnavigated Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Vikings (8th–11th century)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•   The Vikings, seafaring Norsemen from Scandinavia, were renowned for their exploration and raids across Europe. Viking explorers such as &lt;strong&gt;Leif Erikson&lt;/strong&gt; reached North America (Vinland) around 1000 CE, long before Columbus. They also sailed across the North Atlantic, settling in Iceland, Greenland, and parts of the British Isles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Chinese (Ming Dynasty, especially under Zheng He, 15th century)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•   During the Ming Dynasty, China embarked on extensive naval explorations led by Admiral &lt;strong&gt;Zheng He&lt;/strong&gt;. Chinese explorers sailed across the Indian Ocean, visiting Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, establishing trade routes and diplomatic relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Polynesians (c. 1000 BCE–1500 CE)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•   The Polynesians were master navigators who explored and settled vast areas of the Pacific Ocean. Using stars, ocean currents, and other natural indicators, they established settlements on islands such as Hawaii, New Zealand, and Easter Island. Their long-distance voyages are some of the most remarkable feats of pre-modern navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Arabs (7th–14th centuries)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•   Arab explorers and traders, particularly during the Islamic Golden Age, played a significant role in exploration. They ventured into Africa, Southeast Asia, and China. Famous Arab explorers like &lt;strong&gt;Ibn Battuta&lt;/strong&gt; traveled across much of the known world, including Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Portuguese (15th–16th centuries)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•   The Portuguese were pioneers of European maritime exploration during the Age of Discovery. Explorers like &lt;strong&gt;Prince Henry the Navigator&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bartolomeu Dias&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Vasco da Gama&lt;/strong&gt; charted routes around Africa to India, establishing key trade routes and colonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Spanish (15th–16th centuries)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•   The Spanish played a central role in global exploration during the Age of Discovery. &lt;strong&gt;Christopher Columbus&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Ferdinand Magellan&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Hernán Cortés&lt;/strong&gt; were among the many Spanish explorers who opened up new lands in the Americas, circumnavigated the globe, and claimed vast territories for Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Mongols (13th–14th centuries)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•   Under the leadership of &lt;strong&gt;Genghis Khan&lt;/strong&gt; and his successors, the Mongols established the largest contiguous land empire in history, stretching from Europe to Asia. While they were known more for conquest than peaceful exploration, the Mongols opened up trade routes (like the Silk Road) and facilitated cultural exchange between East and West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Malian Empire (13th–16th centuries)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•   The &lt;strong&gt;Malian Empire&lt;/strong&gt;, especially under the rule of &lt;strong&gt;Mansa Musa&lt;/strong&gt;, was a center of learning and trade in West Africa. While not typically known for overseas exploration, there are accounts, such as those of Mansa Abubakari II, that suggest the Malians may have launched expeditions across the Atlantic before European contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Romans (27 BCE–476 CE)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•   The Roman Empire expanded its reach through exploration, trade, and conquest, stretching across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Roman explorers traveled as far as India and China through trade routes like the Silk Road, and Roman merchants reached distant parts of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These civilizations were driven by different motives—whether trade, conquest, religious spread, or scientific curiosity—and they left lasting impacts on global history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous explorers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several famous non-Western explorers made significant contributions to exploration and the expansion of knowledge about the world. Here are some of the most notable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zheng He (1371–1433)&lt;/strong&gt; – A Chinese admiral and diplomat during the Ming Dynasty, Zheng He led seven major voyages across the Indian Ocean, reaching as far as the east coast of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and Southeast Asia. His expeditions greatly expanded China’s maritime influence and established extensive trade networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ibn Battuta (1304–1369)&lt;/strong&gt; – A Moroccan scholar and traveler, Ibn Battuta journeyed across Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, India, Southeast Asia, and China over a period of nearly 30 years. His travels, documented in the &lt;em&gt;Rihla&lt;/em&gt; (The Journey), provide a detailed account of the cultures and societies he encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xuanzang (602–664)&lt;/strong&gt; – A Chinese Buddhist monk and traveler, Xuanzang made a famous pilgrimage from China to India in search of sacred Buddhist texts. His 17-year journey through Central Asia and India was instrumental in spreading Buddhist knowledge and culture throughout Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abu al-Hasan al-Masudi (c. 896–956)&lt;/strong&gt; – Often called the “Herodotus of the Arabs,” al-Masudi was an Arab historian and geographer who traveled extensively in the Middle East, Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. His works, including &lt;em&gt;The Meadows of Gold&lt;/em&gt;, offered insights into the cultures, geography, and history of the regions he visited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Piri Reis (1465–1553)&lt;/strong&gt; – An Ottoman admiral, geographer, and cartographer, Piri Reis is famous for his maps, especially his world map of 1513, which includes a remarkably accurate depiction of the Americas and Antarctica. His work contributed to Ottoman naval exploration and cartography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mansa Abubakari II (fl. 14th century)&lt;/strong&gt; – The Malian emperor is believed to have organized two large expeditions to explore the Atlantic Ocean, long before Columbus. Some legends suggest that his explorers may have reached the Americas, although this remains a subject of debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These explorers, originating from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, played crucial roles in the expansion of global knowledge and exploration.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>The Hidden Pitfalls of Modern Startups: Striking a Balance Between Ambition and Sustainability</title><link href="https://touch4tech.dev/the-hidden-pitfalls-of-modern-startups-striking-a-balance-between-ambition-and-sustainability.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-22T08:52:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-22T08:52:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Rezpe &amp; Oberron</name></author><id>tag:touch4tech.dev,2024-06-22:/the-hidden-pitfalls-of-modern-startups-striking-a-balance-between-ambition-and-sustainability.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Hidden Pitfalls of Modern Startups: Striking a Balance Between Ambition and Sustainability&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landscape of modern startups is fraught with both opportunities and challenges. As we delve into this complex environment, it's crucial to understand why many innovative solutions often face difficulties in sustaining themselves in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many entrepreneurs invest in promising solutions on platforms like Kickstarter, only to find their hardware rendered obsolete when the necessary servers are no longer maintained due to the startup's financial struggles. This leads to a situation where functional hardware becomes "bricked" because it lacks the necessary support infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Dual Challenges Facing Startups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main issues at play. Firstly, large corporations use their influence and lobbying power to create barriers for new competitors, thereby maintaining their market dominance. This practice stifles competition and innovation in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, startups often have unrealistic ambitions and profitability expectations. They aim for rapid, double-digit growth without establishing a healthy and realistic growth path. This is in stark contrast to companies like Logitech and Valve, which have gradually built their success over decades. Logitech, for example, started with making mice and keyboards and gradually expanded and improved their product lines. Valve began with a few video games and eventually developed Steam, a platform that revolutionized digital game distribution. NVIDIA, too, took 30 years to reach its current status in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Unicorn Fallacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure to become the next "unicorn" – a startup valued at over a billion dollars – often leads startups to seek spectacular returns on investment. This approach can be detrimental, as it focuses on rapid growth and high returns rather than building a sustainable business model. If we had more "gazelle" companies, which are smaller but grow steadily, the ecosystem would be richer and more diverse, catering to various user needs more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market's demand for innovation varies, with different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as cost, time efficiency, cool factor, and novelty driving the requirements. To address this diverse demand, we need various types of startups, each targeting specific niches rather than aiming for mass-market appeal. This approach not only caters to smaller user groups but also fosters long-term relationships and market creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building a Sustainable Market&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a sustainable market means addressing the needs of a recurring customer base, which can lead to the development of previously non-existent or invisible markets. For instance, Logitech's focus on gaming keyboards met a demand that wasn't recognized 30 years ago. Their dedication to quality and understanding of their customers' needs has made them a global leader in gaming keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge lies in creating a compute solution that doesn't follow the current startup model. The current approach to innovation, driven by the startup mentality, is fundamentally flawed. Instead of aiming for explosive growth, companies should focus on building small, dedicated user communities and using resources like cloud services for prototyping and technology implementation without massive upfront investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Tech Industry's Indigestion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's tech industry is experiencing an indigestion of technology, where rapid development outpaces thoughtful integration. The rise of Generative AI (Gen AI) exemplifies this issue. While Gen AI offers numerous benefits, the rush to capitalize on it has led to a lack of strategic implementation. Companies are eager to automate tasks with Gen AI without considering whether these tasks are meaningful or necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rush results in the proliferation of "bullshit jobs" – roles that exist merely to give the appearance of productivity. Instead of focusing on genuinely valuable contributions, companies prioritize activities that are easily measurable, leading to a focus on quantity over quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Redefining Success in the Tech Industry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these issues, we need to rethink our approach to innovation and success in the tech industry. Startups should aim for sustainable growth, focusing on building trust with their customers and creating long-term value. This means prioritizing quality, understanding the real needs of the market, and avoiding the pitfalls of rapid, unsustainable expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By fostering a diverse ecosystem of smaller, steadily growing companies, we can create a more resilient and responsive market. This approach not only benefits consumers but also ensures that technological advancements are meaningful and sustainable, ultimately leading to a healthier and more balanced tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>History of computing</title><link href="https://touch4tech.dev/history-of-computing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-30T06:57:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-30T06:57:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Rezpe &amp; Oberron</name></author><id>tag:touch4tech.dev,2024-04-30:/history-of-computing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;History of computing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of computing has been marked by a series of groundbreaking innovations, beginning with the "Mother of all Demos" in 1968 by Douglas Engelbart, which introduced the world to the mouse, graphical user interface (GUI), video conferencing, and more, laying the foundation for future computing paradigms. This was followed by the development of the personal computer (PC) in the 1970s, revolutionizing computing by making it accessible to individuals and small businesses. The introduction of the Internet in the 1980s transformed the way information is shared and accessed, leading to an explosion of digital content and connectivity. The 1990s saw the advent of the World Wide Web, further democratizing access to information and leading to the dot-com boom. The early 2000s were defined by the emergence of mobile computing, with smartphones bringing the power of a computer into the palm of our hands, and the launch of cloud computing, which allowed for the storage and processing of data over the Internet, providing scalability and flexibility previously unimaginable. Today, we stand at the brink of a new era with devices like the Vision Pro, which integrate augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and artificial intelligence (AI) to create immersive, intelligent, and highly personalized computing experiences. This journey from the "Mother of all Demos" to today's cutting-edge technologies showcases the relentless pace of innovation in computing, each step building on the last to create a world where digital and physical realities are increasingly intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Outsourcing decision should be driven by outsourcee profitability analysis.</title><link href="https://touch4tech.dev/outsourcing-decision-should-be-driven-by-outsourcee-profitability-analysis.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-12T13:58:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-12T13:58:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Rezpe &amp; Oberron</name></author><id>tag:touch4tech.dev,2024-04-12:/outsourcing-decision-should-be-driven-by-outsourcee-profitability-analysis.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Outsourcing decision should be driven by outsourcee profitability analysis.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idea : it makes sense if the cost saving for the outsourcer is higher than the benefit outsourcee is expected to provide to its share holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why suggestion this definition: the outsourcee  has to return some of the profits to share holders thus, lower cost implies that the efficiency gains brought by external operation have to be higher than the industry average P/E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposed result: on topics where the industry has reached plateau and minor efficiency differences exist between players, internalising the function might actually allow systematic cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost_internal/unit -cost_external/unit &amp;gt; profit_external/unit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is not enough to suppose that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since cost_internal/ unit &amp;gt; cost _external/unit outsourcing will be beneficial !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Areas where it is likely to be true are when fixed cost have a high ratio of the total cost (dedicated factory, …) or if the internal usage ratio of a ressource is not close to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Areas where fixed costs are a low % might seem at first beneficial but they will mostly reduce cost by reducing quality. This will in time destroy value in the long run for both outsourcer and outsourcee.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Prompt for basic English definitions</title><link href="https://touch4tech.dev/prompt-for-basic-english-definitions.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-06T04:44:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-06T04:44:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Rezpe &amp; Oberron</name></author><id>tag:touch4tech.dev,2024-04-06:/prompt-for-basic-english-definitions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Prompt for basic English definitions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geek version of this title being  “* as code”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLDR; code is short for explicit knowledge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why is increasing the ratio of explicit knowledge necessary and a trend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful observation about human knowledge is captured in the polyani paradox, of which the challenge to land back on the moon is the most visible example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend of expliciting knowledge is rooted first in SW as machines can be defined as 0 implicit knowledge intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer scientists have addressed this challenge for humans by building systems to make this training from grounds up always easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to move knowledge to explicit knowledge, they build the following stack incrementally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code: explicit procedural and information processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code versioning as code (git, svn, … as opposed to file naming and zip file)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;codespace as code (github code space)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pipeline as code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;infrastructure as code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CMS as code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more and more professions get increasingly reliant on IT tools, this leads to the perception that SW is eating the world, where what really happens is just transfering swath of implicit - domain specific- knowledge, into an explicit knowledge repository hosted on machines (either local file systems or Wikipedia, YouTube, …)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/176f095c535f40c88a9cbe3e53b46348"&gt;polyani-paradox&lt;/a&gt; is that we know more than we can tell, or in other words that implicit knowledge is larger than the explicit knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while youtube tutorials have somehow reduced this gap, there is still a huge gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Andersen said SW is eating the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the merchants which overthrew castles (US independance, French Revolution,…) and spread wealth in houses, while universities replaced temples as the places where knowledge was shared and developed but the caserns prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However it seems that temples have been on the back since the late XIXth century, when looking at stock market around the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confirmation bias:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;a href="https://citybeautifulblog.com/2022/02/24/nyse-building-a-roman-temple-with-glass-walls/#:~:text=The"&gt;article &lt;/a&gt;is just a confirmation bias but beautifully written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Falsification bias:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;online markets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economy presents itself as a science grounded in complex mathematics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The question:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can / Should stock-exchange building should be considered as temples?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The implication:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets can create huge inequalities between big players and small players as they developped from an open market to markets with centralised buying/selling power at some point of the value chain, chocking masses of sellers / buyers of their profits and margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long term effect is that Investment is rewarded equally independent of the risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Convexity</title><link href="https://touch4tech.dev/convexity.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-11-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-11-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Rezpe &amp; Oberron</name></author><id>tag:touch4tech.dev,2022-11-19:/convexity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Convexity means gain well if things go well, but don’t lose that much if it goes poorly.

&lt;p&gt;From 1999 to 2007, smartphones were phones with keyboards, no touchscreen or single finger touch specified by network operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Education as fractional distillation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time education as been organised in a similar way to fractional distillation. Kids would go through increasing selection similar to a fractional distillation
designed in a way that only a small proportion a what enters the system can make it to the top:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first stage at the bottom, the first to exit the distillation is the lowest volatility and highly viscuous like tar - unqualified workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second stage with higher volatility are used in manufacturing and commercial heating - factory workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the third stage the light distilate make it to the top of the tower - engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at the very top are the very gas that will not condensate (propane, butane) - doctors &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sisyphus trying to catch-up with AI education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However nowadays it seems that education is moving to a fat tail (aka power law): a small proportion of people are on top of leading edge topics and unless one is 
coached from the inside it is impossible to get in as the speed of development is too fast. One such topic is &lt;code&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/code&gt;. So many papers are published so
fast that no one can stay on top (unless already inside), as the growth in publication and pre-print is exponential &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342547853_Recommendations_for_machine_learning_validation_in_biology"&gt;1 Fig 1.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, many topics from changing a light bulb to very simple AI/CNN topics are explaine on YouTube, GitHub or StarckOverflow meaning anyone can solve a simple 
problem with only a few hours or searching the Internet (aka "Hello World" or "3 fingers coding").&lt;/p&gt;

(2020). Recommendations for machine learning validation in biology. Modern biology frequently relies on machine learning to provide predictions and improve decision processes. There have been recent calls for more scrutiny on machine learning performance and possible limitations. Here we present a set of community-wide recommendations aiming to help establish standards of machine learning validation in biology. Adopting a structured methods description for machine learning based on DOME (data, optimization, model, evaluation) will allow both reviewers and readers to better understand and assess the performance and limitations of a method or outcome. The recommendations are complemented by a machine learning summary table which can be easily included in the supplementary material of published papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;khan academy: but they stopped investing on non-video content: exercises and even removed from the public domain the knowledge graph.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one side, we have created a research environment where radical ideas can not flourish. On the other hand, we have been sold the idea that adult people can not cope with uncertainty and need simple and already proven solutions. This contrast is creating an environment where:
- novel solutions are not being communicated nor developed
- people are losing trust with experts
- people are losing time with existing solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a time where we are dealing with new types of crisis, this is becoming a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are obscure knowledge pockets and it is difficult to get information on those. For example, we know the ingredients of tooth paste or soap but we do not know why we chose those ingredients. Sometimes they were chosen for cost reasons but they are unhealthy for a certain part of the population. Or they were chosen based on solid research foundations. However, consumers lack that kind of visibility: research is either privately owned (not shared) or hidden for obvious reasons (unethical grounds).
The consequence of this is that people are simply rejecting the use of those products with for example all natural products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format of science communication is the PAPER: a static document with a limited amount of figures and pictures. This contrasts with the latest formats of communication distribution based on Internet:
- Information instantly available
- Easy to update and change
- Interactive
- Linked and Searchable
- Different Media formats: Infographics, Video, Sounds, ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also say that universities have become like the church: we have a dogma imposed this time not by God but by experts who are regarded as experts by their peers. They run entire research facilities and their word decides the publicability of an idea. They can reject ideas if it contradicts previous ideas published by them. This means that some ideas can not be challenged, only extended: even if this can reach a knowledge dead end. For example, the copenhagen interpretation [1] has laid the foundations of the current physics and chemistry theory but its view are becoming outdated and other novel approaches need to be developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a view in the consumer area that is hindering the development of novel ideas: the aproach to them (Hypothesis-Expermentation-Insight and Knowledge) is complex and therefore people will not "get" it. This is a simplistic view on people and does not seem to be validated, just a belief. Adult people should be able to understand and accepts this way of working, specially for novel types of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true (and) proven that people show herd behaviour that are detrimental to the group. For example, people get crowded in exits in case of emergencies [2], but as the referenced paper implies, solutions can be built to prevent those from happening. Therefore there must be ways to communicate and handle complex information to inform citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say politics and managers are sometimes all talk and no action, as they are unable to cope with the current crisis, but we can say that they were not trained for this new novel situations that require a different attitude. The true problem is not solving the crisis or complaining, but teaching ourselves and others how to cope with them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Collect Visualize Model and Optimise (CVMO) pyramid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this article proposes a unified way to interlink data, information, knowledge, wisdom and evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change of paradigm being instead of focusing on the desired results (stronger evidence, data or information, ...) to focus on the actual steps required to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pyramid becoming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Optimise
Model
Visualize
Collect
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect data: this can be either finding existing data sets or establishing new methods for collecting data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualise data: this is the art or science known as data vizualisation (aka &lt;code&gt;data-viz&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model data: how the different variables (or dimensions) of data are related to each other. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once a model is established it can be used to make predictions and also run multiple scenarii.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is often in the field of science (pure or apply) or engineering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimise has actually two dimensions:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimising actions towards a dedicated outcome (known as wisdom in the &lt;code&gt;DIKW pyramid&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimising of the model either to simplif it (&lt;code&gt;accam's rasor&lt;/code&gt;) or optimising the model to reduce the gap between the model predictions and observed changes in data when actions are undertaken.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press for instance allowed the appearance of mass produced books with it's spread of ideas and communication between government and citizens. This has permitted the rise of democracies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are seeing now new innovations that are making possible the creation of new ways of managing a state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, language specifications like the catalogs programming language allow to define q certain part of the law corpus as a set of rules that make it easy to compute ( without having a human reading the whole set to find the applicable career).
Ethereum allow for the creation of decentralized contracts. This has 2 advantages: 
- no required human to validate the contract (and saving the fees)
- automatic check of the contract application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public websites are much better at sending information both in terms of timing (no constraints on timing) and of format: files or even visualizations can be sent in order to improve citizen readability and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combination of structured law text and public websites could allow for rapids creation and application of laws. For example when COVID was raging, laws were depending on the number of cases that day, so it was very difficulty to track. This could substitute the current law diffusion system which is based on long daily files full of new laws and addendi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online referendi make it possible to spread information and get citizen or use opinion instantly. For example, teams from Microsoft let attendees send live questions and vote already submitted questions. This gives priority to the interest of the majority in real time and automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PowerPoint Karaoke&lt;/code&gt; of business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only rule in a &lt;code&gt;Powerpoint Karaoke&lt;/code&gt; is for the show person to never retreat from a clain and own all the statments made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly the business world be it in big business or in startup has turned more into being convincing when presenting than value creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The underlying principle in action is that actors (the ones presenting) or spectators are entering a state of &lt;code&gt;Suspension of Disbelief&lt;/code&gt; where consitency across all presentations trumps verification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which leaves no place for constructive criticism (except still in deep technical organisation) especially when it comes to verify business assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In business another rule is to stick to the branch or industry &lt;code&gt;Buzzword Bingo&lt;/code&gt; semantics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startup will also oscillate between obsession and failure whereas impro theater will focus on the flow and public feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camel start-up stand-out when it comes to business (corporate or unicorn startups) as focus on customer income is key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving to the &lt;code&gt;Aikido of Conway&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of fighting the corporate business, identify its strength and use them for your work/life balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given that any organisation will deliver products and service matching its internal organisation as per the &lt;code&gt;Conway's Law&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Align internal structure with customer need to ensure delivery are aligned with needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One must not seek to fight it but like in aikido unify this energy in a &lt;code&gt;Aikido of Conway&lt;/code&gt; best examplifies lately by &lt;code&gt;RenDanHeYi (人单合一)&lt;/code&gt; from Hayer's CEO (Zhang Ruimin - 张瑞敏).

There are some exceptions in some industries like trading, where robots are heavily used, but in other sectors it is not the case. Another example is ebay where robots are participating in auctions at the last minute to get the item at a minimal price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the spread of data and API's is making possible a world where more and more robots could be used in every aspect of our lives. In that case, the gap between companies using robots and automation and those not using it will drive the latter ones to extinction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we can even think of a future where robots coexist with humans. This will bring challenges we have not faced before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those challenges is in the stock market where we already have robots competing for stocks. Those robots were programmed with human competition and not with robot competition. Sometimes, the situation gets out of control and they must stop the bots immediately to prevent problems in the stock market (like price hikes or cyclic prices)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, machine learning is enabling robots to generate content. Those robots could even consume content to create artificial demand for that content. This is a challenge for platforms like youtube who need to differentiate between humans and robots to measure the real interest and distribute the ad money.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="idea"></category></entry><entry><title>Thoughts on Information</title><link href="https://touch4tech.dev/thoughts-on-information.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-09-17T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-09-17T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>oberron</name></author><id>tag:touch4tech.dev,2021-09-17:/thoughts-on-information.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Information can be zoomed in or out so for example we can start with an idea which can be set in 45 seconds generated in 3 minutes up to the 10,000 hours that is the time need to become an expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And data has different formats: text, images, audio, ... Text can even have color highlighting like code, so there's a blur between the data formats. Also web technologies and other innovations like markdown allow for the creation of this mix of formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also information is a graph because data is linked:
- to the sources or references: either other articles or supporting data. This is what is done for example in papers.
- to the required information you need to understand the article. Those requirements could be gathered like in SW where you have tools like apt-get that retrieve the SW packages needed to run a SW project. And then you'll learn those concepts to understand the article. Or ew could think of performing an exercise that would check your level of knowledge and then complete the gaps in knowledge to be ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could even say that a degree it just a snapshot of the score in those exercises. And as time passes you would need to refresh knowledge or update it. Also, the best way to learn seems to be a mix of unstructured peer learning mixed with the Japanese sensei style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally those requirements depend on the expectation that you have:
- you might want to go deep if you are an expert (down to the axioms) 
- or just have a high level of understanding for casual readers&lt;/p&gt;

- Startup way based on the promise of high returns to get investment and hard work to make it happen.
- Research way where no revenue promises are made but less ressources are provided&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The startup way has triumphed and technology has permitted the rise of the Californian Startups (FAANG + MS): huge companies with high revenues.On top of that those companies cannot be cut down as they werer in the past.
We all remember how AT&amp;amp;T got cut in smaller companies in the past. However Facebook today remains unchanged, partly because the USA needs a big competitor against big foreign companies like Tik Tok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However those companies are today unable to innovate. Google has amassed 135 billion euros and does not know how to invest that money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that the products of those big companies are now even becoming fashion as they're not adding new game changer features. For instance, Galaxy Flip 3 phone would be an example of a device bought for its aesthetics more than its function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also see that every new wave of devices stops innovation at the previous device. We went from mainframe, to desktop PC to mobile phones.

 - Urban
 - With money
 - takes transport alone
 - seeking comfort&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple takes profit from a higher end market and charges huge amount of money for their services. Apple would then offer their premium cars and then would offer higher end services on top of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the services Apple would offer is automated + remote driving. Uber, Lyft,... companies in the transportation sector spend 80% of their revenues in driver salaries. Self-driving is not possible at 100% of cases, but can handle 80-90%. Remote driving would solve the difficult remaining cases. This is a big game-changer. It would be based on remote driving centers, like the drone command centers in the military world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason Apple has not released yet the car has more to do with fabrication. It seems all ear building centers are already used by a competitor, so it's a no go for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="prediction"></category></entry><entry><title>Information Funnel</title><link href="https://touch4tech.dev/information-funnel.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-08-12T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-08-12T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>oberron</name></author><id>tag:touch4tech.dev,2021-08-12:/information-funnel.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Problems in sources of information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Society advances when information goes faster from brain to brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the identified problems with the information we currently consume:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No source of information is given&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook Google and other companies are keeping us in information bubbles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are better features in some channels for example Google News understands better than Google search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommenders are opaque systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, corporations do not want to divulge how they recommend. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly machine learning models are difficult to understand because you human categories are not the same as machine categories and we do not have words to describe them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of noise and quantity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a lot of so-called influencers or expert just throwing information. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantity is more important than quality and becomes the sole KPI to maximize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easy to gather on the internet articles which summarize the evolution of clothes. For instance, Buzzfeed has created some viral videos regarding the evolution of clothing in the western world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another completely unrelated field in the technology world. This field features the appearance of gadgets and software products whose existence is made possible thanks to the latest advancements in technology and linked to the time those breakthrough appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both worlds are based on trends and feature important actors that have changed everything (Fashion by Coco Chanel for example and Technology by Steve Jobs). Those figures are extremely public and are representative of the breakthrough of the time they lived in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And more importantly, both fields are marked by followers. Trends are made to be followed, copied, venerated ... So it is worth to ask ourselves the question: why people do follow trends instead of deciding by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems people have a limited amount of decisions per day. This phenomenon is called Decision Fatigue. This explains why people would delegate certain decisions to external parties like recognized elites or public figures. This delegation process requires trust and the trust is usually reached through social agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is in Quantum physics where the Copenhagen Interpretation. This interpretation comes from Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg and they are regarded as the main experts in this field. It is the most commonly taught quantum physics interpretation but as the wikipedia article shows, it is not the only one ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent news however suggest french fashion is now playing catch-up with 6 deals so far which is higher than other countries.

&lt;p&gt;The question for which we will try to give an answer in the coming months and years: will this be enough?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="business"></category></entry><entry><title>What is French-Touch.tech</title><link href="https://touch4tech.dev/what-is-french-touchtech.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-05-19T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2016-05-19T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Rezpe</name></author><id>tag:touch4tech.dev,2016-05-19:/what-is-french-touchtech.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;What is the french way ?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know some old cliches: the accent, the cuisine, the glamour (as shown in the french bashing documentary). It is an abstract concept that is difficult to describe. We can start perhaps to grasp this concept by listing some well known french actors in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dance music industry, the french touch is a very influencial EDM (Euro Dance Music) type of music, known for &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;its characteristics which include disco samples, robotic vocals and heavy filter and phaser effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those were very successful in the 90’s but now they are showing their aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the videogame industry, Ubisoft is a well established brands with a very unique graphical and story-telling style. They are the creators of series like Assasin’s Creed or Far Cry, that were very original at the time and put Ubisoft in the list of AAA games developper. However, they have not innovated since then, which can be seen in the opinion of some gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess you start to see the pattern. Same can be said about the nuclear energy in France, the education system with the Grandes Ecoles, the french traditional cuisine, … Even the french luxury brands are surviving not thanks to traditional customers but asian people who are discovering the brand now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is interesting to understand why this is happening in the french industry. I think the main reason this happens relies on the way french cultivate excellence. They do not nurture creativity or motivate people. Instead, they rely on a very strict and rigurous selection system that provides almost all the ressources to a few in the top. Every school or system is ranked and the top 10 almost get all ressources. This means that the cost of not being in the top is REALLY high and explains why change is not permitted once you are in the top. This can be applied to almost any field in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does France renew itself then ? Well, outside of this ranking system, there are many people who have been left out or have chosen not to be part of it. France has one of the most creative startup systems in the world (and if they are not in the France they are somewhere else). Ebay founder is french for instance. The french indie game ecosystem is very powerful winning regularly prizes on worldwide events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are they waiting for to be well known ? They need the big players to give them the opportunity which can only happen if they disappear or consumers switch massively to the new products. Agar.io started as a prototype and has now millions of players wordwide. Dofus started as a pet project of two french guys and they have now television series and more videogames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the cycle starts again.&lt;/p&gt;
